A DOS terminal Game of logical analysis

Game introduction:
1. There are totally 20 tiles with number from 0 to 9 in 3 colors.  Red and Blue color tiles are from 0 to 4 and from 6 to 9. 
So there are 9 Red tiles and 9 BLue tiles. there are two Green tiles are number 5. 

2. at the begining, you as a player will be given 5 tiles randomly. The sequence of sorting is from small to large and red color 
should be in the left if you have two same numbers. the number you have will be told at the beginning. 

3. there are 2 NPC which are Daisy and Melon. (my wife and son's English Name). they will be given 5 tiles as well randomly. But 
as a player, you don't know what do they have. 

4. Games will list 6 questions randomly to you, you can choose to let NPC to answer. Though the answer, you will be able to analyze
which could be NPC's number. There are totally 26 questions you can ask, but normally you can conclude NPC's number in less than 10
times QA. 

5. If you think you know NPC's number, then you can exit the game. Then the game will tell you what are NPC's number then you can 
check if you are right. 

Purpose: 
The purpose of creating this game is that I am not good at this game as My wife and Son. So I want to use this game to practice 
more. Before that, I am also thinking to use a program to analysis the number instead of me. But it is not so easy for me to implement, 
I will do it later.
